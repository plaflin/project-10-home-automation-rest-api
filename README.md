# project-10-home-automation-rest-api

This Team Treehouse project is a Spring Rest Data project that incorporates features such as HATEOAS, Spring Security and a HAL browser.  
There are three users hard coded into the DatabaseLoader class.  These are User1 and User2 with regular user capabilities and Admin who has the Admin role in the system.  Each user's password is their name.  

This is the first project I've coded that was set up by feature and not layer.  Normally, the packages would be model, dao, service, etc but this time I arranged them by feature: Controls, Devices, Rooms, and Users.  I can see why people would choose to do it either way.  I just wanted to lay this project out by feature because that is what was covered in this section of the curriculum.
